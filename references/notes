public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    // code to be executed
  }
}
// myMethod() is the name of the method
// static means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class. You will learn more about objects and how to access methods through objects later in this tutorial.
// void means that this method does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in this chapter

// To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;
// In the following example, myMethod() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:

public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
  }
}

// Outputs "I just got executed!"

// A method can also be called multiple times:

public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
  }
}

// I just got executed!
// I just got executed!
// I just got executed!
